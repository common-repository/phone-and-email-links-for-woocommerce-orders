== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

It takes the email and phone number of the customer, from the order, and it displays the phone and email as two links on the Orders page.

= What happens when I click a link? =

That depends on which link you click. The phone link has the tel: attribute and therefore, will only work on phones. The email is just a simple mailto: link which will open whatever application you have set as default to handle / manage email on your device.
